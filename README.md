Hi, I’m Deborah Oyeniyi. I’m interested in working with a company that needs a virtual assistant. I just finished my learning on ALX as a virtual assistant. I’m looking to collaborate with any company that prioritizes growth and teamwork while applying my skills to achieve productivity and effectiveness. You can reach me through my email: mariamoyeniyi93@gmail.com. I have a heart that is willing to learn.
